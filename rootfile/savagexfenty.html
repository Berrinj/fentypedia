      <h1>SAVAGE X FENTY</h1>

<p>"As a kid, I've always used fashion as a defense mechanism," she continued. "But that, and music, and makeup, and lingerie, these are all just different ways I can express my creative."

"It's all me as the muse," Rihanna said about her brand and fashion show. "It's all me that's like, behind everything." <br>
"There's not a target audience — it's for everyone," Rosales said of the Savage X Fenty show.

"Everything that she does is for everyone," she continued, discussing Rihanna. "She wants everyone to feel beautiful, everyone to feel empowered, everyone to feel and have that strength within them to become the best version of themselves.</p>

<p>"Your attitude is what makes you Savage. It’s the confidence that you have in yourself, and it’s the confidence that you can give off to people who look like you and feel like you, and those are the people that identify with the brand."<br>
-Rihanna</p>
